![ScreenShot](https://adatechri.com/iRecPreview.png)  
  
# Known Issues  

* If you are running iOS 8.3 or above, the resulting recording may freeze on a random frame at times, and then start recording again.  
* Apple Watch remote does not work yet, it is only a GUI.
* On iOS 9 devices, the app crashes when you start or stop recording.
  
# Please note that the iOS 9+ version of iRec will most likely not be public, in terms of releasing an open-sourced version of the app. Thank you for understanding.
