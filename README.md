# iRec - iOS 7-8 Screen Recorder  
  
![ScreenShot](https://private.adatechri.com/iRecPreview.png)  
  
# Known Issues  

* If you are running iOS 8.3 or above, the resulting recording may freeze on a random frame at times, and then start recording again.  
* Apple Watch remote does not work yet, it is only a GUI.
* On iOS 9 devices, the app crashes when you start or stop recording.
  
# If you happen to find a way to support iOS 9+, please be aware that the update will most likely not be public, in terms of releasing an open-sourced version of the app. Please privately notify me of anything if anyone finds a way to do this. Thank you.
